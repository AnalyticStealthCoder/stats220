### STATS220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

# A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in *Bachelors of Science majoring in Computer Science and Statistics*
- I am taking **STATS 220** because I want to familiarise myself with R programming Language
- I am interested in learning about the different feature of R programming an how it enables us to to perform statistical analysis
- **Math is fun**... sometimes
