### STATS220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

# A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Bachelors of Science majoring in Computer Science and Statistics
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to familiarise myself with R programming Language
- I am interested in learning about the different feature of R programming an how it enables us to to perform statistical analysis

# What is my morning routine?

3. Go for a run
4. Shower
5. Head to uni (RIP)
